## SMART GOALS

### Cade
  By the end of spring quarter, I hope to create a tool that helps journalists and citizens understand the environmental hazards around them. My primary goals are to level up on my data acquisition and analysis capability while adding new tools for front end development. That will involve gaining familiarity with CSS, HTML, and Java. I hope to use scraping to add more granularity to a dataset and then use my newly acquired front end skills to create engaging and interactive graphics. This project may also require learning version control and cloud hosting to have a script run regularly without taking up local computing power. 

### Katherine
  By week 10 of Spring Quarter, Iâ€™m hoping to create a long-lasting tool that will download and pull in data from our chosen dataset, vet and filter it and prepare it for front-end visualization that will allow users to put in a location and view superfund sites and their updates (if any) near them. In regards to skillsets, I will be leveling up in my Python and HTML skills, learning CSS and Javascript, and learning Observable to achieve my data scraping goals. I am also hoping to create a tool to automatically work through the data set we're using to check for updates and report those updates to our front-end application! 

### Anna
  My goals for the class are centered around learning how to create reactive visualizations using more complex front-end coding skills. My ideal goal would be to build on my pre-existing html, css, and java skills to learn how to use D3. By Week 10, I hope to use D3 and perhaps Observable to create/help create the customizable charts, grahps, and maps. I also hope to aid my teammates on the data cleaning part of our project and push-notification part of our project, and learn version control using git.
