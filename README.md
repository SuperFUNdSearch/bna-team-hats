## SMART GOALS

### Cade

### Katherine
#### By week 10 of Spring Quarter, Iâ€™m hoping to create a long-lasting tool that will download and pull in data from our chosen dataset, vet and filter it and prepare it for front-end visualization that will allow users to put in a location and view superfund sites and their updates (if any). In regards to skillsets, I will be leveling up in my Python and HTML skills, learning CSS and Javascript, and learning Observable to achieve my data scraping goals. I am also hoping to create a tool to automatically download and work through the data set we're using to check for updates and report those updates to our front-end application. 

### Anna
#### My goals for the class are centered around learning how to create reactive visualizations using more complex front-end coding skills. My ideal goal would be to build on my pre-existing html, css, and java skills to learn how to use D3. By Week 10, I hope to use D3 and perhaps Observable to create/help create the customizable charts, grahps, and maps. I also hope to aid my teammates on the data cleaning part of our project and push-notification part of our project.
