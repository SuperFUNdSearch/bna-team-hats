## SMART GOALS

#### By week 10 of Spring Quarter, Iâ€™m hoping to create a long-lasting tool that will download and pull in data from our chosen dataset, vet and filter it and prepare it for front-end visualization that will allow users to put in a location and view superfund sites and their updates (if any). In regards to skillsets, I will be leveling up in my Python and HTML skills, learning CSS and Javascript, and learning Observable to achieve my data scraping goals. I am also hoping to create a tool to automatically download and work through the data set we're using to check for updates and report those updates to our front-end application.
